Simple Satellites 2
==========

An adaptation of the community-developed continuation of the original RemoteTech mod for Kerbal Space Program, for SimpleRockets 2.

RemoteTech allows you to construct vast relay networks of communication satellites and remotely-controlled unmanned vehicles.
Your unmanned vessels require an uplink to a command station to be controlled.
This adds a new layer of difficulty that compensates for the lack of live crew members.
